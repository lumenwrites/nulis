Tree editor for writers.

# Todo
# Main

### Big
- [ ] Export markdown
- [ ] Card splitting and merging
- [ ] Focus on subtree, goalscape style. Workflowy-like breadcrumb of parents.
- [ ] Payments.

### Small
- [ ] Up/Down between card groups
- [ ] Gear in the card to change color/setting.
- [ ] Autosave trees by name, so it wouldn't replace them.
- [ ] Probably shouldn't display droptargets on parents/children at all.
- [ ] Nulis prefs. Max columns, what else?
